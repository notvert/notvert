Capstone Proposal

Name: Project Game Data

Project Overview: Display "cool" data from Riot Games API focused on _League of Legends_

- What are the major features of your web application? Display interesting data/results from Riot Games API into a Django project
- What problem is it attempting to solve? Improve gameplay via knowledge of historical play 
- What libraries or frameworks will you use? Riot Games API (https://developer.riotgames.com/), RiotWatcher (https://github.com/pseudonym117/Riot-Watcher), and more that I'll discover
 
Functionality:

- What will they see on each page? Index page will have a field to input user name and region of user (start off with just myself as the user), pulls match history
- What can they input and click and see? Fields to input user name and region
- How will their actions correspond to events on the back-end? Pull data from API

Data Model: 

I envision that some key findings will be from lots of historical data on one user and I also find it interesting to get data from a friend that the primary user plays with. Not sure how the two data models will intersect yet - never worked on that before.

Schedule:

- Week 1/Milestone 1: Get index.html working with match history for 1 player (5 games)
- Week 2/Milestone 2: See how much total data I can pull from 1 player and pick the relevant data to present
- Week 3/Milestone 3: Evaluate if I can pull data from 2 players and then compare them in a relevant way (Stretch Goal)
- Week 4/Milestone 4: CSS, make everything look better
